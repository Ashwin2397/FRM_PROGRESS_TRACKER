# Overview
* A simple CLI application developed with the sole intention of being a "proof of concept" demo project
* Developed with python and sqlite3

## Purpose
* Purpose is to keep track of progress in world aclaimed finance certification, FRM
* A fully functioning prototype that is the basis and inspiration for my current web app project

## Caveat
* Code is yet to be refactored to different files 
* Code has not been heavily documented
* Codebase was developed fairly long ago, hence lacks best practice and certain software design patterns
